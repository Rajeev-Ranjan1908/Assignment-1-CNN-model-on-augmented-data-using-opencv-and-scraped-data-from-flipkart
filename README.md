# Assignment-1-CNN-model-on-augmented-data-using-opencv-and-scraped-data-from-flipkart

Build a deep learning based Image classification model on 100 Images scrapped (for each category) + augmenting the training folder data from flipkart for the below categories :


1) Trousers (men) (100 images)
2) Jeans (men) (100 images)


Following augmentation techniques has been performed on all the images in your training dataset:
Rotation Range (-30,30)
Brightness (Increasing the brightness of the images once)
Brightness (Decreasing the brightness of the images once)
Flipping the images
Sharpening
